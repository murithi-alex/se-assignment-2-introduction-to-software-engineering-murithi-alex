# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
It is the systematic application of Enginering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Engineering involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products
Software Engineering applies scientific and mathematical principles to the design, analysis and implementation of software systems while tradition Programming, on the other hand, is mainly concerned with writing code to solve specific problems

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Requirements: Involves gathering and documenting user needs and software requirements.
2. Design: It involves creating a high level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface
3. Implementation: It involves writing code and building software according to design specifications
4. Testing: It involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
5. Deployment: It involves releasing the software to the users or customers
Maintenance: It involves providing ongoing support, updates and enhancementsto the software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall involves a sequential approach with distinct phases e.g (requirements, design and implementation) flowing downward like a waterfall.
While the agile involves an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
Waterfall is good for short term project while Agile methodology is good for long term projects

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
A systematic and strict approach to the definition, creation, and verification of requirements for a software system. It entails several tasks that help in understanding, recording, and managing the demands of stakeholders.
1. Helps ensure that the software being developed meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders
2. Can help identify potential issues or problems early in the development process, allowing for adjustments to be made before significant 
3. Helps ensure that the software is developed in a cost-effective and efficient manner
Can improve communication and collaboration between the development team and stakeholders
4. Helps to ensure that the software system meets the needs of all stakeholders.
Provides an unambiguous description of the requirements, which helps to reduce misunderstandings and errors.
5. Helps to identify potential conflicts and contradictions in the requirements, which can be resolved before the software development process begins.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity the software is divided into various components that work together to form a single functioning item but sometimes they can perform as a complete function if not connected with each other.
It improves maintainability by isolating changes within individual modules, siplifying troubleshooting and making testing easier.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing is done at the code level, where each component is tested individually to ensure their impartiality and analyze their functionality.
Integration testing enables software testers to test group units integrated into a system or subsystems; it helps identify any bugs or issues arising from coding errors or integrations between modules.
System testing is performed on an integrated environment comprising the whole application, where all components are assessed against specific business requirements.
Acceptance testing involves testing the system’s Functional and Non-functional aspects, such as performance, security, usability, accessibility, compatibility, and reliability.
It is crucial because it reduces project risk, providing confidence in the software quality, meeting compliance needs, ensuring satisfied users, enabling continuous improvement, and reducing overall costs

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code
They are imortant because they help the developer team to efficiently communicate and manage(track) all the changes that have been made to the source code along with the information like who made and what changes have been made
Examples: Concurrent Versions System (CVS), Git and Apache Subversion (SVN) 
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A software project manager is a a person who takes the overall responsibilities to manage the software projects and plays an important role in the successful completion of the projects
Responsibilities: Project planning which involves estimating several characteristics of a project and then plan the project activities based on these estimations. Project monitoring and control which is significant in making sure that business goals are achieved successfully

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software Maintenance refers to the process of modifying and updating a software system after it has been delivered to the customer.
The goal of software maintenance is to keep the software system working correctly, efficiently, and securely, and to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the users

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Unethical data collection, Weak security, Algorithm bias 
Being accountable: Making sure you keep your employer, clients, customers, and other stakeholders in the loop by reporting software issues and other potential ethical issues in software development.
Being honest: This is to be straightforward and truthful while describing your goods. Inform the audience if the vision changes


Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
