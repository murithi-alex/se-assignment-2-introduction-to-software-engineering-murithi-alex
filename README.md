# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
It is the systematic application of Enginering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Engineering involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products
Software Engineering applies scientific and mathematical principles to the design, analysis and implementation of software systems while tradition Programming, on the other hand, is mainly concerned with writing code to solve specific problems

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Requirements: Involves gathering and documenting user needs and software requirements.
2. Design: It involves creating a high level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface
3. Implementation: It involves writing code and building software according to design specifications
4. Testing: It involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
5. Deployment: It involves releasing the software to the users or customers
Maintenance: It involves providing ongoing support, updates and enhancementsto the software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall involves a sequential approach with distinct phases e.g (requirements, design and implementation) flowing downward like a waterfall.
While the agile involves an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
Waterfall is good for short term project while Agile methodology is good for long term projects

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
A systematic and strict approach to the definition, creation, and verification of requirements for a software system. It entails several tasks that help in understanding, recording, and managing the demands of stakeholders.
1. Helps ensure that the software being developed meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders
2. Can help identify potential issues or problems early in the development process, allowing for adjustments to be made before significant 
3. Helps ensure that the software is developed in a cost-effective and efficient manner
Can improve communication and collaboration between the development team and stakeholders
4. Helps to ensure that the software system meets the needs of all stakeholders.
Provides an unambiguous description of the requirements, which helps to reduce misunderstandings and errors.
5. Helps to identify potential conflicts and contradictions in the requirements, which can be resolved before the software development process begins.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity the software is divided into various components that work together to form a single functioning item but sometimes they can perform as a complete function if not connected with each other.
It improves maintainability by isolating changes within individual modules, siplifying troubleshooting and making testing easier.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing is done at the code level, where each component is tested individually to ensure their impartiality and analyze their functionality.
Integration testing enables software testers to test group units integrated into a system or subsystems; it helps identify any bugs or issues arising from coding errors or integrations between modules.
System testing is performed on an integrated environment comprising the whole application, where all components are assessed against specific business requirements.
Acceptance testing involves testing the systemâ€™s Functional and Non-functional aspects, such as performance, security, usability, accessibility, compatibility, and reliability.
It is crucial because it reduces project risk, providing confidence in the software quality, meeting compliance needs, ensuring satisfied users, enabling continuous improvement, and reducing overall costs
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?


Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
